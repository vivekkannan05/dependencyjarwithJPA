# dependencyjarwithJPA
This project is simple Spring Boot starter with JPA 

This is learning project where I create simple Spring JPA dependency Jar which would be called by another project. 
For example another Springboot application with rest controller.

This example is used to see how the properties from the calling project gets passed to this jar and as well to see how the bean of this jar are being initialised by calling project
